# life-rpg
---
life-rpg is a very simple 2D game. It is written with the languages of the web(HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript). C or C++ would have
been chosen for this project, but since it takes approximately 2 seconds to save a JavaScript file and see the results in the
browser, I chose to make a web game.

The main goal of this project is to just teach myself more about game development. I have a lot of experience in Unity3D, but I
have realized that Unity takes care of a lot of the heavy lifting. I would like to try to just learn more about how basic game development
works.

If life-rpg actually does become a game, it will be free for everyone, and free forever.
