# web-game
---
The sole purpose of web-game is for me to teach myself more about game development. Using tools such as Unity3D and Unreal Engine 4 take care of a lot of the work for you and I want to learn some of things they do behind the scenes.

I choose to do this over the web(HTML5 and JavaScript) so I will not have to worry about learning OpenGL or DirectX right now. I plan to do this in the future, but right now I want to focus on other things.

Feel free to take a look at the source code. There will be some parts that are great, and other parts that are not so great. You are encouraged to give feedback if you see anything that you think could use improvement.
